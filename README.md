## Alien Invasion! Game
___
This is my implementation of the ___Pygame Project___ in the [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e "Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition"). 

To play:
Run alien_invasion.py from your terminal. cd into the repo folder and run the following code: 
```bash
python alien_invasion.py
```
Press ESC or q to quit the game. Use Spacebar to shoot bullets. 
You can reset the highscore by emptying the highscore.txt file.

I will be making some changes to make it more Star-Wars themed and add special elements and powers soon. I'll also add an .exe file for the game.
